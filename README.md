This is a step by step code tutorial found at webpack2 site.
[webpack.js.org/guides/get-started](https://webpack.js.org/guides/get-started/)

As plus I added babel (transpile a little piece of es6 to es5), editorconfig (from react/redux project) and a development/production environment (mainly from gokulkrishh.github.io blog)
